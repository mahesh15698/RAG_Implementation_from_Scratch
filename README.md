# RAG System

RAG System is a simple implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the concept of cosine similarity.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a basic RAG system to retrieve relevant information from a corpus of text based on user queries. The system calculates the cosine similarity between the query and each document in the corpus to determine the most relevant response.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: collections, math

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahesh15698/RAG_Implementation_from_Scratch.git
